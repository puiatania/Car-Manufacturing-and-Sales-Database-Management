# Database-for-Managing-a-Company-Specialized-in-Car-Manufacturing-and-Sales
This project includes a relational database for managing a car manufacturing and sales company. It is divided into two components:

BD (Databases - SQL): Implements the database schema, data manipulation, and analytical queries using SQL.
SGBD (Database Management Systems - PL/SQL): Includes PL/SQL procedures, functions, triggers, cursors, exception handling, and advanced queries to enhance database functionality.
The system enables data-driven decision-making by tracking production costs, sales trends, promotional impact, and customer preferences. It also supports investment analysis, product popularity tracking, and performance evaluation of marketing strategies.
